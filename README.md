# Lightsheet microscopy whole brain 3D nuclei instance segmentation
## 2D Unet-based

### Motivations:
 - None has developed a nuclei instance segmentation for whole brain.
 - Lightsheet microscopy 3D image has anisotropic resolution.
 - Resolution is isotropic in X-Y plane.

### Data:
Multiple whole brains of mouse in different grown stage. Each brain has > 1000x9000x9000 voxels.

### Performance and time cost:
 - Recall > 90% 
 - Precision > 90%
 - Time cose < 24 hr/brain

### Codes availability
 - [x] Train 2D Unet
 - [ ] Run whole brain
