## Train 2D Unet in X-Y plane using cellpose tool

### Motivations:
 - X-Y plane has the most reliable manual labels with isotropic resolution
 - Cellpose is a compatiable tool with friendly training commands for 2D instance segmentation with a round shape. 

### Usage
 1. Fellowing `cellpose/environment`, install the environment of python.
 2. Change data directory in `.sh` files.
 2. Run `.sh` files under this directory.
 3. Get the model weights under the train data directroy.
